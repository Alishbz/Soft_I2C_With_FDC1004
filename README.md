### Capacitance method for measuring the level of a fluid.

Capacitive fluid level sensors are measurement devices which typically consist of a single probe which acts as an immersed electrode inside a tank. This probe interacts with an opposite electrode, usually the wall of a tank, and the two are connected together to form a capacitor.

The fluid contents of the tank act as the dielectric medium, which will affect the capacitance created between the two electrodes. If the fluid level rises and falls, this will change the capacitance measured by the probe in a predictable way, and therefore it can be used very effectively as a measurement of fluid level.

### Purpose of this Project

The aim of this project is to calculate the filling rate of the water bottle with the capacitive sensor.
It is also designed to measure software I2C usability. Software I2C is designed as a software independent from hardware, portable, can be integrated to any desired pin.
